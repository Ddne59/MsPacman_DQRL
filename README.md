# Deep Q-Network for Ms. Pac-Man

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a project where a Deep Q-Network (DQN), a type of deep reinforcement learning, is applied to learn and master the classic arcade game Ms. Pac-Man. The project leverages the principles of Q-learning enhanced with deep neural networks to process the game's visual input and devise optimal strategies. The main goal is to maximize the score in Ms. Pac-Man by autonomously navigating through levels while avoiding ghosts and collecting points.


## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ddne59/MsPacman_DQRL.git
```

## Results
Include some snapshots or gifs of the trained model playing Ms. Pac-Man along with a description of the performance metrics such as average score and highest score achieved. This section can illustrate the effectiveness of the DQN model.
